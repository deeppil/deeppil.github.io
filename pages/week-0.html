        <p class="blog-text">
            For the past few months, I have been challenging myself with juggling multiple projects and ideas at once, and although I have learned and my ideas have developed and grown(some scrapped), I am not entirely satisfied with the efficiency of the ordeal. 
            I can't help but believe that there must be a better system for learning and developing things entirely on my own, it must be possible as many have done so before. 
<br><br>
            To tackle this conundrum and streamline my process of reflection and learning, I’ve decided to start a devlog (or idealog, or journal, whatever you want to call it). 
            Here, I’ll document my progress and thoughts on the projects I’m working on—and perhaps even some unrelated topics. 
            The goal is not just to help myself get projects done, one at a time, and grow in the years to come. I also hope that, if something fruitful and inspirational comes out of my work, others will be able to reap the benefits of my shared experiences(both successes and failures).
<br><br>
            To begin with, I will be exploring the field of <b>Electronics(core), with some mathematics and machine learning in the side</b>, the end goal is not certain yet, but I have a few ideas of what to explore. The field of electronics is vast, and as a mostly software oriented person myself 
            it troubles me that I don't understand the entire inner workings of what makes software possible. I hope to update progress weekly or bi-weekly, and will share my challenges and successes along the way. My goals for the next few months are:
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Master Arduino</li>
                <li>Basic embedded systems </li>
                <li>Communication systems and protocols</li>
                <li>Learn about microcontrollers and microprocessors</li>
                <li>Transition to Esp32</li>
            </ul>
